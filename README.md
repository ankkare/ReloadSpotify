# ReloadSpotify

This is an AutoHotkey scripts that I made to skip ads in Spotify free desktop version.
I realized that if you close Spotify and open it again when an ad appears, the ad will be skipped.
This script will close spotify, run it and continue to play the music you listened to before the ad.

## Installation

1. Have Autohotkey v2.0 intalled
2. Download ReloadSpotify.ahk
3. Edit path to your spotify.exe file.

## Usage
1. Run script
2. Press Alt+t to skip spotify ad.
